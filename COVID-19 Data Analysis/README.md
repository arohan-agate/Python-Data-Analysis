The purpose of this project is to find if there are any evident relationships between the number of COVID-19 cases in a country, and how developed it is (taking GDP, welfare, life expectancy, etc. into account).

**Observations**

The main takeaway from this project is that the development of a country has a direct relationship with the number of recorded COVID-19 cases. Countries with the highest GDPs, life expectancies, and best welfare all saw the highest number of recorded COVID-19 cases. This pattern can be supported by the fact that more developed countries have the means to record COVID-19 cases more efficiently and at greater volumes, compared to developing countries. Additionally, more developed countries tend to have higher populations, as the opportunities they hold are attractive to people all over the world. Higher populations, in turn, lead to viruses, like COVID-19, spreading much more quickly.
